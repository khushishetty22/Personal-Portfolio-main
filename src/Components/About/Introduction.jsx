            Hello! With a profound passion for data and transformative technology, I have honed a comprehensive skill set that includes advanced proficiency in Python, SQL, and R, supplemented by certifications in AWS and Microsoft Excel. My education at Syracuse University, where I completed a Master of Science in Information Systems and a Certificate of Advanced Study in Data Science, has equipped me for complex data analysis, visualization, and cloud-based solutions. I am adept at using platforms such as Tableau, Power BI, and Databricks, facilitating the deployment of sophisticated, cloud-enabled analytical tools. Currently, I am looking for opportunities to leverage my skills in practical applications, particularly in data analytics and cloud engineering, aiming to collaborate with industry professionals and contribute to innovativeÂ projects.
