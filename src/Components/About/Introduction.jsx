            Hey there! I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems at Syracuse University, with a fervent passion for data analytics and cloud technology. My academic and hands-on experience has equipped me with expertise in Python, Pandas, SQL, AWS, Azure, Docker, and Databricks, enabling me to tackle complex data analysis, visualization, and the deployment of cloud-based solutions. Certified in Blockchain and Python Scripting, I'm continuously expanding my skill set. Eager to apply my knowledge in real-world settings, I'm seeking summer internship opportunities in data analytics and cloud engineering to further my career and contribute to innovative projects. I look forward to connecting with professionals and enthusiasts in the field to exchange ideas and collaborate on transformative initiatives.
